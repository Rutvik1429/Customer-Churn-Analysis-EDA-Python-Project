# Customer-Churn-Analysis-EDA-Python-Project
This repository contains a customer_churn_analysis using python(EDA-Exploratory Data Analysis).Churn Analysis is the process of identifying customers who are likely to stop using a company‚Äôs product or service.

### ‚úÖ Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques in Python. Customer churn refers to customers who stop using a company's services or products. The primary aim is to identify patterns, trends, and factors that lead to customer attrition, helping businesses understand customer behavior and take proactive steps to reduce churn.

The dataset used in this project is the Telco Customer Churn dataset, which contains customer information, services subscribed, demographic details, and churn labels.

# üéØ Objective
## The key objectives of this project are:
‚úÖ To explore customer data and understand the distribution of features.
‚úÖ To preprocess data by handling missing values, incorrect data types, and converting categorical variables.
‚úÖ To visualize the relationships between customer attributes and churn behavior.
‚úÖ To uncover patterns and insights that contribute to customer churn.
‚úÖ To provide actionable insights that can help businesses improve customer retention.

# üìÇ Dataset Description
## The dataset includes the following fields:
Customer information: gender, senior citizen, tenure, etc.
Services: Internet, phone service, online backup, etc.
Charges: monthly and total charges.
Churn label: whether the customer has churned (Yes/No).

# üîç Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Missing values in the TotalCharges column were replaced with 0.
Data types were converted to appropriate formats for analysis.
The SeniorCitizen feature was transformed from numerical values (0, 1) to categorical labels (No, Yes) for better interpretability.
The dataset was checked for inconsistencies and corrected where necessary.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Churn Distribution
```python
# Set the size of the plot (width=3 inches, height=4 inches)
plt.figure(figsize=(3, 4))

# Group the data by 'Churn' and count the occurrences
gp = df.groupby("Churn").agg({"Churn": "count"})

# Create a pie chart
# - Values to plot: the count of each churn category
# - Labels: the unique churn categories (Yes/No)
# - autopct: format to show percentage values with 2 decimal places
plt.pie(gp["Churn"], labels=gp.index, autopct="%1.2f%%")

# Add a title to the plot
plt.title("Percentage of Churned Customers")

# Save the plot as a high-resolution PNG file
# - dpi=2000 ensures very high quality
# - bbox_inches='tight' ensures no extra whitespace around the image
plt.savefig("Percentage of Churned Customers.png", dpi=2000, bbox_inches="tight")

# Display the plot
plt.show()
```
